This is my second C# project for CF. It's a blogging platform. Anonymous users can view the blog posts and comments, while logged in users have different access depending on their UserRole. In addition to writing and publishing blog posts, it allows for leaving comments, tagging, searching and pagination, and has different permission levels for different roles like user, moderator, or admin. Custom Services allow for image uploads, automatic slug generation, email contact page, autopopulation with lorem-ipsum seed data, and multiple Connection Services. The front end uses the free Clean Blog template from Start Bootstrap https://startbootstrap.com/theme/clean-blog along with a little bit of custom CSS, JS, and Bootstrap.
